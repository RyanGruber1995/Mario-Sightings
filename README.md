# Mario-Sightings
One of my favorite streamers on Twitch plays Mario Maker 2 and allows people to bet in his channel on which one of two randomly chosen sprites will show up first as he is playing through levels. For example, the bet could be between a 'piranha plant' and a 'pow block' and people will first place bets before starting the first level. If a piranha plant appears before a pow block does, the people who bet on piranha plant win channel points (fake currency in each streamer's channel) while the people that bet on pow block lose all of the channel points they bet with. The [mario_sightings.xlsx](https://github.com/RyanGruber1995/Mario-Sightings/blob/main/mario_sightings.xlsx) spreadsheet is a self-made spreadsheet that tracks the information of what matchups have occured, the win rates against those matchups, and the overall win rates for each sprite. This way, I know the likelihood of each sprite winning and can decide what I feel like betting on each time a new bet is allowed. This data was collected since June 2023. Please refer to the [Overview.md](https://github.com/RyanGruber1995/Mario-Sightings/blob/main/Overview.md) markdown for explanations of each tab in the Excel file.
